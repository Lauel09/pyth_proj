# Start of everything
## This is a poor written python program to delete duplicate file except leaving one duplicate one.
---
How this could be made better:-
* A better criteria of deciding whether there are other duplicate copies or not.
* Any file with 5-10 characters,i.e, a file with size less than 0.0001 Kilobytes are considered duplicates of each other, this is lethal for files including important text less than 20 chars.
* Currently uses counter,will sometime write it without using one.
